This repository is for CHEM502 Workshop 1 - comparing experimental and DFT calculated redox potentials.

First, choose your basis set, functionals, and cas numbers in cas_to_inp.py

Once you've run with gaussian and gotten the .log files run extract_oxidation_potentials.py to create a .csv file of the results.
